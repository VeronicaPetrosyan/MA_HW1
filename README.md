# Bass Model Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the diffusion of **Figure 02** using the **Bass Diffusion Model**. A historical innovation, **Honda ASIMO**, is used as a reference, with **worldwide industrial robot shipment data** as the historical dataset. The model estimates key parameters from historical data and forecasts future adoption trends.

## Repository Structure
- `data/` - Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `report/` - Contains the final report and markdown source file.
- `script/` - Python scripts for data analysis and modeling.
- `img/` - Visualizations generated during analysis.

## Outputs
- Estimated Bass Model parameters (`p`, `q`, `M`).
- Graph showing observed vs. predicted adoption.
- Forecasted adoption for future years.
